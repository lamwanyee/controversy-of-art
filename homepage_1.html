                <p>Controversy in art arises from various sources, including challenging established norms, pushing boundaries of acceptability, and prompting strong reactions from viewers. This can involve taboo subjects, shocking imagery, or artistic techniques that defy tradition. Additionally, art can be controversial due to clashing interpretations, the artist's gender, or even the materials used.</p>

                                <h4>Controversy of Art around 19th century</h4>
                                <div class="ticks-list"><span><i class="fa fa-check"></i> The 19th century saw several art controversies, often stemming from artists challenging traditional standards of beauty, subject matter, and technique. One prominent example was the criticism of Impressionism, with critics lambasting its lack of detail and focus on fleeting moments. Other controversies arose from artists like Courbet and Manet, whose works, like "A Burial at Ornans" and "Olympia," were met with shock and outrage due to their realism and depiction of common subjects.</span> <span><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Realism and the Challenges to Established Norms, 
                                  Gustave Courbet's "A Burial at Ornans":
                                  This monumental painting, with its unflattering portrayal of ordinary mourners, was condemned for its lack of idealization and its depiction of everyday life. 
                                  Édouard Manet's "Olympia":
                                  Manet's depiction of a courtesan, a subject not traditionally considered worthy of high art, and his unconventional painting style, caused a scandal.
                                  </span> <span><i class="fa fa-check"></i> The Rise of the Salon des Refusés and Independent Exhibitions:
                                    The Paris Salon's rejection of many artists led to the establishment of the Salon des Refusés, a separate exhibition showcasing the works of rejected artists.
                                    Independent Exhibitions:
                                    Some artists, like the Impressionists, organized their own exhibitions to showcase their work outside the confines of the Salon.
                                    </span> <span><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Impressionism and the Rise of Modernism:
                                      Rejection of Academic Standards:
                                      Impressionist artists, like Monet, rejected the rigid rules of the Paris Salon, which favored classical subjects and meticulous brushwork. 
                                      Critique of "Unfinished" Style:
                                      Critics often ridiculed Impressionism for its apparent lack of detail, unconventional brushwork, and bold color palettes. 
                                      The "Impression, Sunrise" Controversy:
                                      The title of Monet's painting, "Impression, Sunrise," was used as a derogatory label to describe the entire movement, highlighting the critics' perception of the art as merely a "glimpse" or "impression" rather than a finished work.

                                <h4>Controversy of Art around 20th century</h4>
                                <div class="ticks-list"><span><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Modernist movements like Cubism, Fauvism, and Abstract Expressionism challenged the traditional view that art should represent reality. Critics said: These works were "ugly," "incomprehensible," or "not real art." In 1913, the Armory Show in New York shocked American audiences with modern European art (e.g. Duchamp’s Nude Descending a Staircase). The public and press backlash revealed a deep resistance to abstraction and experimentation.</span> <span><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Dadaists (like Marcel Duchamp) rejected the very concept of art as a serious pursuit, mocking tradition and institutions. Duchamp's Fountain (1917), a urinal signed “R. Mutt,” questioned what could be considered art. It was seen as a prank or insult to real artists. Helped birth conceptual art, shifting focus from craft to idea.
                                </span> <span><i class="fa fa-check"></i> The Nazi regime deemed modernist works (Expressionism, Surrealism, etc.) as "degenerate" (Entartete Kunst) and un-German. Artists targeted: Kandinsky, Klee, Chagall, and many more. Art became political; regimes tried to define what was culturally acceptable.</span>
                                  <span><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Pop artists like Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein blurred the line between high art and mass culture. Critics said it was shallow, commercial, or derivative. Warhol’s Campbell’s Soup Cans (1962) mocked consumerism but was also consumed by it.</span> <span><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Female artists like Judy Chicago and Ana Mendieta challenged the male-dominated art world. The Dinner Party (1979) celebrated women in history but was attacked as vulgar or politically charged. Issues raised: Censorship, gender exclusion, and the role of female bodies in art.</span> <span><i class="fa fa-check"></i> In the 1980s–90s, artists like Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano sparked moral panic. Piss Christ (1987): A crucifix submerged in urine → accused of blasphemy. Mapplethorpe’s erotic photography → debated in U.S. Congress. Culture wars over public funding, religious values, and free expression.</span> <span><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Many works emphasized idea over execution, challenging traditional skill-based criteria. Yoko Ono’s Cut Piece (1964) – viewers cut her clothing off. Piero Manzoni’s Artist’s Shit (1961) – literal cans of his feces sold as art. Seen by some as gimmicky, offensive, or meaningless.</span></div>

                              <h4>Controversy of Art around 21th century</h4>
                                <div class="ticks-list"><span><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Generative AI has sparked a tremendous backlash across the internet, as the early promise of the technology has been overshadowed by the wide range of problems it has introduced.</span> <span><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Generative AI has given the public the means to instantly create an image, or piece of writing, that looks as though it took time and effort. Art can now be manifested via the touch of a button, a prompt or two, as effortless as ordering fast food.</span> <span><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Technology is a solution to a problem that never existed. Artists, as much as they like to complain about the struggle of the creative process, enjoy making things. The creative process is incredibly rewarding, even if the final piece doesn’t match up to the original vision.</span>
                                  <span><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Artists are watching the skills that they have spent their life sharpening being devalued before their eyes.Worse, their work was absorbed into the dataset without their knowledge or consent; they have been used to train their own replacement, and no one asked for permission.</span> <span><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Example - The Studio Ghibli AI art trend - OpenAI unveiled its new image-generation tool for ChatGPT last week, which allows users to transform images into different styles, including the Studio Ghibli style.Many users have taken to X to share examples of AI-generated Ghibli-style internet memes.Mr Miyazaki once called artificial intelligence in animation "utterly disgusting" and "an insult to life itself".He even said he would "never wish to incorporate this technology into [his] work at all".Today, nearly a decade later, the internet is awash with AI-generated images replicating his style.</span> <span><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Why is the trend controversial? - Ms Szapiro notes that OpenAI is exploiting Miyazaki's world, though it can never truly capture the essence of his work, as it fails to grasp the fundamental human element that is essential to art."They do not understand art, they understand profit, so it can't possibly capture the soul of Miyazaki's artwork," she said."Almost anyone under 35 in the Western world has grown up with Ghibli films and that comfort and safeness and the beauty of Miyazaki's world is being. </span></div>
